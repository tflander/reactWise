# reactWise

Wise session to spike out JSON & react rendering for the dashbord overview.

We could use this in a REST / JSON service for alerts as well as the ocean workflow webapp.

We would transform the data structure built by the DashboardOverviewBuilder to a JSON array of DashboardStatusItem objects.

Review the HTML Spike batchedCurrentAndArchive.html.  See how it works, then execute TODO#1 to design a JSON object 
to represent the dashboard overview, rather than the batch lists.
